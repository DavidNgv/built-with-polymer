[Tabbie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabbie/kckhddfnffeofnfjcpdffpeiljicclbd) is a Chrome extension that keeps you informed, inspired, and up to date across a variety of communities. It replaces the New Tab page with your favorite websites. The developer Jari Zwarts made Tabbie for a fully customizable experience and to showcase Polymer + Material Design on the desktop. With beautiful design and smooth animation, Tabbie follows Google's design principles to the bone. Sites like Hacker News, GitHub, Dribbble, Designer News, and Behance are currently supported with more to come soon.
